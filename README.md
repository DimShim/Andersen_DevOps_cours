# Self-introduction:

- My name is Dmitry Shimanel, I'm an electronics engineer. 
- Graduated from BSUIR with a degree in electronic systems. 
- Have been working in electronics for more than six years, also managing a group of engineers in electronic equipment repair domain.

# Reasons for my interest in the course:

1. Since I was a student, I have been fond of creating and configuring local networks, setting up servers, as well as automating routine tasks on Windows OS with scripts. 

   Taking the latest IT trends into account, I continued to develop my interest in technologies in the direction of cloud services and virtualization, so DevOps is the most          logical path for my further professional development.

2. In my work, I value result most of all, when the repaired equipment starts to run like clockwork. A year ago, I started to research how the software of the equipment itself         works, how to launch it locally and remotely  to reach uninterrupted work. So I came back to thinking about DevOps professional area.

3. I have had some challenging experience working with information security, leakage and storage of user data. 

   Professional knowledge of DevOps will allow me to improve information security skills and develop further in the direction.

# My expectations from the course:

- detailed presentation of material with additional brainstorming and feedback on confusing points
- self-learner practical approach when it comes to homework 
- ability to get a job offer to become part of Andersen team
